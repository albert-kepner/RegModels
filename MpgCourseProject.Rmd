# Analysis of mtcars Dataset With Respect to Whether Automatic versus Manual Transmissions Significantly Affect Vehicle Fuel Efficiency (miles per gallon)

## Executive Summary

## Exploratory Data Analysis
 - show means for mpg grouped by automatic and manual transmissions
 - show correlation of mpg with each of auto, wt, hp
 - show scatter plots of mpg with respect to these 3.
 
## Model selection

show multiple models and compare with anova and confidence intervals on coefficents.


## Residual Plots and Diagnostics

## Conclusions

## Appendix

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
